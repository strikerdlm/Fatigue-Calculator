# Optional Deep Learning Dependencies for Enhanced Fatigue Calculator
# Install these if you want to use the CogPSGFormer-inspired features
# 
# Prerequisites: Make sure you have the core requirements installed first:
# pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Then install these deep learning dependencies:
# pip install -r requirements-deeplearning.txt

# TensorFlow (recommended for CogPSGFormer implementation)
# Supports Python 3.8-3.11, tested on Windows
# Documentation: https://www.tensorflow.org/install
tensorflow>=2.15.0

# PyTorch (alternative deep learning framework)
# Documentation: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
torch>=2.0.0
torchvision>=0.15.0
torchaudio>=2.0.0

# Transformers for attention mechanisms (Hugging Face)
# Used in CogPSGFormer architecture
# Documentation: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/installation
transformers>=4.30.0

# Additional ML libraries for deep learning features
tensorflow-probability>=0.20.0  # For probabilistic modeling
keras>=2.15.0                   # High-level neural networks API

# Advanced visualization for deep learning models
tensorboard>=2.15.0            # TensorFlow visualization toolkit

# Note: These dependencies are large (several GB) and not required for core functionality
# The enhanced fatigue calculator works fully without these packages
# They are only needed for future CogPSGFormer deep learning integration
