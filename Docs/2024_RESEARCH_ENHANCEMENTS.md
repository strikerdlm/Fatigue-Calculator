## 1. Adenosine Dynamics and Glial Modulation

### Scientific Background
Recent research has identified the critical role of adenosine system dynamics and glial cells in sleep regulation, extending beyond the traditional Two-Process Model.

### Citations
- **Glial involvement in sleep regulation**: https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/48/3/zsae314/7954489
- **Adenosine system in sleep inertia**: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38782198/

### Implementation
```python
def enhanced_homeostatic_process(t, prev_reservoir_level, asleep, ai, sleep_quality, 
                                sleep_quantity, adenosine_level, individual_factors):
    K_base = 0.5  # Base sleep pressure accumulation rate
    
    # Adenosine dynamics enhancement (2024 research)
    adenosine_factor = 1 + (adenosine_level - 1) * 0.3
    
    # Glial modulation factor (2024 research)
    glial_factor = 1 + (sleep_quality - 0.5) * 0.2
    
    # Adjusted calculations with new factors
    K_adjusted = K_base * (1 + (8 - sleep_quantity) * 0.1) * adenosine_factor * deprivation_sensitivity
    as_factor = 0.235 * glial_factor
```

### Key Findings
- Adenosine level modulates sleep pressure accumulation by up to 30%
- Glial cells contribute to sleep quality effects on recovery

    elif sleep_duration >= 4:
        max_duration = 0.5   # 30 minutes for moderate restriction
    else:
        max_duration = 1.0   # 60 minutes for severe restriction
    
    # Bifurcation effect for severe sleep restriction
    restriction_multiplier = 1.0
    if sleep_restriction_days > 2:
        restriction_multiplier = 1.5 + (sleep_restriction_days - 2) * 0.3
    
    # Adenosine-dependent decay rate
    base_decay_rate = 0.067  # Updated from 0.04
    decay_rate = base_decay_rate * (1 + adenosine_level * 0.3)
```
